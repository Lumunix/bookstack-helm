# Chart version and changelog policy

When you add functionality, templates, sample values files, or user-facing docs for the `bookstack` chart:

- Update `charts/bookstack/Chart.yaml` `version` in the same change.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change with a matching `## [<version>] - YYYY-MM-DD` section.
- Add `### Title` and `### Description` for that version so the release workflow can publish them.
- Use at least a patch bump for additive/backward-compatible changes.
- Keep `appVersion` unchanged unless the BookStack image/app version changes.
- Mention the version bump in the change summary.

Examples of changes that require a version bump:

- New or updated templates under `charts/bookstack/templates/`
- New values keys or sample values files under `charts/bookstack/`
- README/CONFIGURATION additions that document new chart behavior
